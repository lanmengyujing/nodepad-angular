A simple note taking app using directives.
We will use  HTML5 localStorage to store the notes.
We will create a directive that will render a notepad.
A user can view the list of notes he/she has made.
When he clicks the button add new the notepad becomes editable and allows a note to be created.
The note is automatically saved when the back button is clicked.
The notes are saved using a factory called notesFactory, with help from localStorage.
The factory code is pretty straightforward and self explanatory.
